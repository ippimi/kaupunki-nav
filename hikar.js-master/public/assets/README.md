The `.obj` assets and accompanying signpost texture in this directory were created by my colleague, Neil Brewis.

The Roboto MSDF fonts cover (I believe, please let me know if otherwise) Western European, Greek and Cyrillic characters and were generated by [Don McCurdy's MSDF font generator](https://msdf-bmfont.donmccurdy.com) using the standard Roboto Regular TTF file.

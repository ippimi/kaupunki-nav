Hikar Webapp
============

This is the repository for the [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js) based Hikar web app, which aims to port the [Hikar](https://hikar.org) Android app to the web. All future development of Hikar will be focused on the webapp.

Now with inbuilt Node.js server meaning you can install the Hikar webapp in one go! An OSM PostGIS database is needed.
